Our product is be a library management system meant for library owners/managers as well as members of the library. This system contains a database of books held by the library, including their author, genre, and title. Keeps track of the book inventory of a library, including the number of books in stock, and where books are located in a shelf. Book holds will also be recorded, with data on return date. Only librarians can manage book details and perform actions such as adding books, updating stock numbers, and removing books. Users can take out loans on books if there is available stock remaining, and return them once their rental period is over. â€¯
